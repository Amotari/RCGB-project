# RCGB-project
This is my first Arduino project, made to understand how the whole process works. The core components are an RGB LED and a button that is supposed to switch the LED’s operating mode when pressed (the modes are described below). An LCD was added as an optimal convenience feature to display the currently active mode.

Video demonstration: https://youtube.com/shorts/1BaNlpvjyzY

The LED has four operating modes (in the first two, the color change interval is 1 second):
RGB (red > green > blue)
YCM (yellow > cyan > magenta)
WHITE (white)
OFF (off — you could call it the “black” color)

Components used:
(1) x Uno R3 (Kuongshun UNO R3 in my case)
(1) x 830 tie-point breadboard
(24) x M-M wires
(1) x RGB LED
(3) x 220-ohm resistors
(1) x push button
(1) x LCD1602 module
(1) x 10k potentiometer
